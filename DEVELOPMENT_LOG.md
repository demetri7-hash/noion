## 🎯 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate Next Steps (Session 2):
1. **🔥 PRIORITY 1**: Complete Toast API Integration Service
   - Create `src/services/ToastIntegration.ts`
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow
   - Add webhook handlers
   - Build data synchronization

2. **🔥 PRIORITY 2**: Create AI Insight Generation Engine  
   - Create `src/services/InsightGenerator.ts`
   - Integrate Claude AI API
   - Build revenue leakage detection algorithms

3. **🔥 PRIORITY 3**: Implement Free Discovery Report System
   - Create `src/services/DiscoveryReport.ts`  
   - Build the "$4,200 lost revenue" calculator
   - Design conversion-optimized report format

---

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE

### Database Architecture:
- **MongoDB with Mongoose** - Flexible schema for POS data
- **Comprehensive indexing** - Optimized for analytics queries
- **Embedded documents** - Reduce joins for common queries
- **Virtual fields** - Calculated metrics on-demand

### Model Design Highlights:
- **Restaurant**: Multi-tier subscriptions, POS integration status
- **Insight**: AI-generated with engagement tracking
- **Transaction**: Normalized POS data with analytics fields

### Key Enums Created:
- `SubscriptionTier`: PULSE, INTELLIGENCE, COMMAND
- `InsightType`: FREE_DISCOVERY, WEEKLY_SUMMARY, etc.
- `TransactionStatus`: COMPLETED, VOIDED, REFUNDED, etc.

---

## 🔧 ENVIRONMENT STATUS

### Dependencies Installed ✅:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.33, React 18, TypeScript 5
- **Database**: Mongoose 8.0.0 
- **Authentication**: bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken
