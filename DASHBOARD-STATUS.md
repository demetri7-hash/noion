# Dashboard Status - October 2, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issues FIXED

### 1. Comparison Percentages (4912% ‚Üí "Insufficient historical data")
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Dashboard showed 4912% revenue increase and 4145% customer increase

**Root Cause:**
- Current period (last 30 days): Sept 3 - Oct 3 with 5,964 transactions
- Previous period (30 days before): Aug 4 - Sept 3 with only 141 transactions
- Data only exists from Sept 2 onwards, so comparison was 30 days vs 2 days

**Fix:**
- Added validation: comparisons only shown if previous period has ‚â•20% of current period data
- Dashboard now shows "Insufficient historical data" instead of misleading percentages
- Will show proper comparisons once you have 60+ days of data

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/api/dashboard/[restaurantId]/route.ts` (lines 149-161)
- `src/components/dashboard/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` (TypeScript types + display logic)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue: Peak Hours Display

### The Problem
**What you see:** "Peak Hours: 1:00 AM - 3:00 AM"
**What you expect:** Something like "6:00 PM - 8:00 PM"

### Why This Happens (It's NOT a bug, it's a timezone display issue)

**The Data IS Correct:**
- Transactions are stored with UTC timestamps
- Peak revenue hour in the database: **1:00 AM UTC**
- **BUT:** 1:00 AM UTC = **6:00 PM Pacific Time** (previous day)

**Example Transaction:**
```
Raw: "2025-09-02T19:43:08.567+0000" (7:43 PM UTC)
Local: Tue Sep 02 2025 12:43:08 GMT-0700 (Pacific)
```

**Top Revenue Hours (UTC):**
1. 1:00 AM UTC - 769 orders, $30,475 ‚Üí **6:00 PM PDT** (dinner rush!)
2. 6:00 PM UTC - 652 orders, $29,077 ‚Üí **11:00 AM PDT** (lunch?)
3. 7:00 PM UTC - 871 orders, $28,766 ‚Üí **12:00 PM PDT** (lunch rush!)

**The Real Peak Hours (in your local time):**
- **6:00 PM PDT** (shown as "1:00 AM UTC") - $30,475 revenue ‚úÖ
- **7:00 PM PDT** (shown as "2:00 AM UTC") - $24,216 revenue ‚úÖ

### Why We Can't Fix It Yet

The dashboard doesn't know your restaurant's timezone. We're displaying UTC times, which are technically correct but confusing.

**What we need to fix this:**
1. Store restaurant timezone in database (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles")
2. Convert UTC hours to restaurant's local timezone for display
3. Show "6:00 PM - 8:00 PM" instead of "1:00 AM - 3:00 AM"

## üìä Current Dashboard Status

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Revenue: $223,730 (accurate)
- ‚úÖ Customers: 5,943 (accurate)
- ‚úÖ Average Ticket: $38 (accurate)
- ‚úÖ Insights: Now showing 2 AI-generated insights
- ‚úÖ Comparison: Shows "Insufficient historical data" (accurate)

### What Needs Improvement:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Peak Hours: Shows UTC time (1 AM) instead of local time (6 PM)
  - **Data is correct**, just confusing display
  - Requires timezone support to fix properly

## üîç How to Read Current Peak Hours

**If your restaurant is in Pacific Time (PDT/PST):**

| Dashboard Shows (UTC) | Actual Local Time | Makes Sense? |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1:00 AM - 3:00 AM | 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM | ‚úÖ Dinner rush |
| 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM | 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM | ‚úÖ Lunch rush |
| 12:00 AM - 2:00 AM | 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM | ‚úÖ Early dinner |

**To find your actual peak hours:**
- Subtract 7 hours from displayed UTC time (if you're in PDT)
- Subtract 8 hours if PST (winter time)

---

## üéØ Next Steps to Fix Peak Hours

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Show "Time shown in UTC")
Add a note on the dashboard: "‚è∞ Times shown in UTC. Your peak hours are 6-8 PM local time."

### Option 2: Proper Fix (Add Timezone Support)
1. Add `timezone` field to Restaurant model
2. Detect timezone during POS connection (from Toast API or browser)
3. Convert all displayed times from UTC to restaurant's timezone
4. Update dashboard to show local times

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours of work

## üìà What You Should See on Dashboard

When you refresh https://noion-zeta.vercel.app/dashboard:

```
Total Revenue: $223,730
Insufficient historical data

Customers Served: 5,943
Insufficient historical data

Average Ticket: $38
Insufficient historical data

Peak Hours: 1:00 AM - 3:00 AM  ‚Üê This is 6 PM - 8 PM in YOUR timezone
$30,000 revenue

Insights: 2 new insights ‚Üê Should now show insights!
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Misleading comparison percentages
- ‚úÖ Insight status mismatch (insights now visible)
- ‚úÖ Revenue calculations verified accurate

**Remaining:**
- ‚è∞ Timezone display needs proper timezone support
  - Data is correct
  - Just showing UTC instead of local time
  - Not critical, just confusing

**System Status:** üü¢ **OPERATIONAL** (with timezone display caveat)

---

**The dashboard is working correctly. The only issue is that peak hours show UTC time instead of your local time. Your actual peak hour is 6 PM, which displays as "1 AM UTC".**
