### Data Flow

1. **Historical Analysis** → Discover patterns from past data
2. **External Context** → Get weather, events, holidays for dates
3. **Correlation Discovery** → Find relationships between factors and sales
4. **Pattern Storage** → Save learnings to database
5. **Prediction** → Use patterns to forecast future
6. **Recommendations** → Generate specific action items

## 📊 How It Learns

### Pattern Discovery Process

**For Each Restaurant:**

1. **Gather Transaction Data**
   - Sales by hour, day, weather
   - Customer behavior
   - Popular items

2. **Fetch External Context**
   ```typescript
   // Get location from Toast API or geocode address
   const location = await locationService.getRestaurantLocation(restaurantId);

   // Get historical weather for transaction dates
   const weather = await weatherService.getHistoricalWeather(
     location.latitude,
     location.longitude,
     transactionDate
   );

   // Get local events that happened on that date
   const events = await eventsService.getLocalEvents(
     location.latitude,
     location.longitude,
     5, // 5 mile radius
     transactionDate
   );

   // Check if it was a holiday
   const holiday = holidayService.getHoliday(transactionDate);
   ```

3. **Calculate Correlations**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Temperature vs Revenue
   const correlation = calculatePearsonCorrelation(
     temperatures,  // [65, 72, 80, 85, 90]
     revenues      // [1000, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2000]
   );
   // Result: correlation = 0.95 (very strong positive)
   ```

4. **Store Pattern**
   ```typescript
   const pattern = {
     type: 'weather_sales',
     whenCondition: 'Temperature above 80°F',
     thenOutcome: 'Revenue increases 25%',
     correlation: 0.95,
     confidence: 92,
     sampleSize: 50,
     restaurantsContributing: 1
   };
   ```

5. **Validate Over Time**
   - Every new data point tests the pattern
   - Accuracy tracked: `timesCorrect / totalPredictions`
   - Patterns below 40% accuracy get deactivated

### Cross-Restaurant Learning

**Global Pattern Building:**

```typescript
// Restaurant A discovers: "Rain → +30% delivery"
Pattern A: {
  scope: 'restaurant',
  restaurantId: 'A',
  correlation: 0.85,
  confidence: 80
}

// Restaurant B discovers similar pattern
Pattern B: {
  scope: 'restaurant',
  restaurantId: 'B',
  correlation: 0.78,
  confidence: 75
}

// System creates GLOBAL pattern
Global Pattern: {
  scope: 'global',
  correlation: 0.815, // Weighted average
  confidence: 85,     // Higher confidence from more data
  restaurantsContributing: 2,
  dataPoints: 150
}

// Restaurant C (new) automatically gets this pattern
// without having to discover it themselves!
```

## 🎯 Correlation Types Tracked

### 1. Weather Correlations

| Pattern | Example | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Temperature → Sales** | "Above 80°F = +25% revenue" | Revenue optimization |
| **Rain → Order Type** | "Rain = +40% delivery, -20% dine-in" | Staffing decisions |
| **Snow → Menu Items** | "Snow = +60% hot drinks, +45% soup" | Menu planning |
| **Extreme Weather → Traffic** | "Below 32°F = -35% foot traffic" | Operating hours |

### 2. Event Correlations

| Pattern | Example | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Sports Events → Sales** | "Stadium game (<1 mi) = +80% revenue" | Staff scheduling |
| **Concerts → Time Shift** | "Concert nearby = early dinner rush" | Prep timing |
| **Festivals → Duration** | "3-day festival = sustained +50% traffic" | Inventory planning |
| **Distance Factor** | "Each mile away = -15% impact" | Promotion targeting |

### 3. Holiday Correlations

| Pattern | Example | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Valentine's Day** | "+120% dinner revenue, +$15 avg ticket" | Reservations, pricing |
| **Mother's Day** | "+200% brunch traffic (busiest day)" | All-hands preparation |
| **Thanksgiving** | "-90% traffic (stay closed)" | Operating decision |
| **Super Bowl** | "+300% takeout, -80% dine-in" | Service model shift |

### 4. Day Type Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Payday Correlation** | "1st & 15th = +18% revenue" | Marketing timing |
| **Day of Week** | "Friday rain < Tuesday rain impact" | Day-specific strategies |
| **Time of Year** | "Summer weekends +35% vs winter" | Seasonal planning |

## 🔮 Prediction System

### How Predictions Work

```typescript
// Tomorrow's conditions
const tomorrow = {
  date: '2025-10-04',
  weather: {
    temperature: 85,
    condition: 'sunny',
    precipitation: 0
  },
  events: [
    {
      name: 'Baseball Game',
      distance: 0.8, // miles
      attendance: 15000,
      category: 'sports'
    }
  ],
  holiday: null
};

// Apply learned patterns
const predictions = await correlationEngine.predict(tomorrow);

// Result:
[
  {
    metric: 'revenue',
    baseline: 2000,
    predictedValue: 3200,
    change: +60%,
    confidence: 88,
    factors: [
      {
        type: 'weather_sales',
        description: 'High temperature increases revenue',
        impact: +20%,
        confidence: 85
      },
      {
        type: 'event_sales',
        description: 'Major sports event nearby',
        impact: +40%,
        confidence: 90
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Confidence Calculation

```
Confidence Score =
  Pattern Accuracy (40%) +
  Sample Size Score (30%) +
  Correlation Strength (30%)

Example:
  Accuracy: 92% → 36.8 points
  Sample: 150 data points → 30 points
  Correlation: 0.85 → 25.5 points
  ────────────────────────────────
  Total Confidence: 92.3%
```
