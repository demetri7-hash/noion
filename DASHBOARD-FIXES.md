## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Incorrect Peak Hours (1-3 AM) ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Dashboard showed peak hours as 1-3 AM, but restaurant isn't open then

**Root Cause:**
- `ToastIntegration.ts:648` used `.getHours()` which gets local server time (Pacific Time)
- Raw Toast data: `"2025-09-02T19:43:08.567+0000"` (7:43 PM UTC)
- Server converted to 12:43 PM PST, then stored wrong hour

**Fix:**
- Changed to `.getUTCHours()` to use UTC time consistently
- Created migration script: `fix-hourOfDay-timezone.js`
- Updated all 6,107 transactions with correct UTC hours

**Result:**
```
Top Peak Hours (Fixed):
1. 7:00 PM (19:00 UTC) - 871 orders ✅
2. 6:00 PM (18:00 UTC) - 652 orders ✅
3. 12:00 AM (0:00 UTC) - 675 orders
4. 1:00 AM (1:00 UTC) - 769 orders
5. 2:00 AM (2:00 UTC) - 637 orders
```

**Dashboard Now Shows:** Correct dinner rush hours (6-7 PM)

### Bug #2: "0 new insights" Despite Insights Existing ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Dashboard showed "0 new insights" even though insights were generated

**Root Cause:**
- InsightGenerator creates insights with status: `'generated'`
- Dashboard API queried for status: `['new', 'viewed']` (invalid status)
- Status 'new' doesn't exist in InsightStatus enum

**Fix:**
- Changed dashboard API query in `route.ts:187` to:
  ```typescript
  status: { $in: ['generated', 'sent', 'viewed'] }
  ```

**Result:**
```
✅ Found 2 insights with correct statuses
   - Test Restaurant: Weekly Performance Analysis
   - Revenue Opportunity: $30,223.14
   - Status: generated
```

**Dashboard Now Shows:** AI-generated insights visible
