  - Recurring schedules (daily/weekly/monthly)
  - Edit until end of day
  - Complete audit trail
  - Points tracking integration

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS: Phase 5 - Gamification System

### ✅ Completed So Far:
1. **Database Models Created:**
   - `src/models/PointsHistory.ts` - Track all points earned
   - `src/models/Badge.ts` - Badge definitions
   - `src/models/UserBadge.ts` - User-badge relationships
   - All models exported from `src/models/index.ts`

2. **Points Calculation Engine:**
   - `src/lib/points.ts` - Complete points calculation logic
   - Features:
     - Task points with bonuses (on-time, early, photo, signature)
     - Workflow points with perfect completion bonus
     - Streak multipliers (7/14/30 day streaks)
     - Level calculation (1-10 based on points)
     - Points awarding with history tracking
     - Streak management

### 🔜 Still TODO for Phase 5:
1. **Badge Checking System** (`src/lib/badges.ts`):
   - Badge unlock criteria checking
   - Auto-award badges when criteria met
   - Badge types:
     - Performance (First Task, Speed Demon, Perfect Week)
     - Consistency (Hot Streak, Unstoppable, Legendary)
     - Team (Team Player, Mentor, Department Leader)
     - Special (Early Adopter, VIP, Legend)

2. **Leaderboard APIs** (`/api/v2/leaderboards/*`):
   - Daily leaderboard (resets at midnight)
   - Weekly leaderboard (Monday-Sunday)
   - Monthly leaderboard
   - All-time leaderboard
   - Query PointsHistory with aggregation

3. **Gamification Integration:**
   - Update task completion API to award points
   - Call badge checking after points awarded
   - Add level-up notifications
   - Add badge unlock notifications

4. **UI Components:**
   - Leaderboard page
   - Badge collection display
   - Points/level progress bars
   - Streak indicators

## 🔑 KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS

1. **NO Socket.io** - Using polling (3s intervals) for chat due to Vercel serverless limitations
2. **Casbin for RBAC** - Inlined model definition for Vercel compatibility
3. **MongoDB .lean()** - Always use for type safety in analytics queries
4. **Points in Restaurant model** - Storing user gamification data in Restaurant.owner fields
5. **Edit until EOD** - Tasks editable until midnight with audit trail

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS

- **Production URL:** Vercel (auto-deploy from main branch)
- **Remote Tunnel:** https://vscode.dev/tunnel/noion-dev/Users/demetrigregorakis/noion
- **All Phases 1-4:** Live in production ✅
- **Phase 5:** Database models ready, engine created, APIs pending
