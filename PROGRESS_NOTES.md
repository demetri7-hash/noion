## 🔑 KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS

1. **NO Socket.io** - Using polling (3s intervals) for chat due to Vercel serverless limitations
2. **Casbin for RBAC** - Inlined model definition for Vercel compatibility
3. **MongoDB .lean()** - Always use for type safety in analytics queries
4. **Points in Restaurant model** - Storing user gamification data in Restaurant.owner fields
5. **Edit until EOD** - Tasks editable until midnight with audit trail
