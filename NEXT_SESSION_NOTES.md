## üéâ What We Accomplished Today

### ‚úÖ Fixed Toast POS Connection Issues
1. **Casbin Authorization**
   - Fixed 403 Forbidden errors on POS endpoints
   - Added direct permissions for `restaurant_owner` legacy role
   - Implemented StringAdapter for serverless Casbin initialization
   - Authorization now working: ‚úÖ `restaurant_owner can create on pos:manage`

2. **MongoDB Connection**
   - Fixed buffering timeout errors in serverless environment
   - Added `connectDB()` calls to Toast POS endpoints
   - Connection pooling working properly

3. **Restaurant ID Storage**
   - Fixed "No restaurant ID found" dashboard warning
   - Now storing `restaurantId` in localStorage during:
     - Signup
     - Login
     - Profile fetch
   - Toast POS credentials persisted in database (encrypted)

### ‚úÖ Signup Flow Improvements
1. **Complete Signup Form**
   - Added all required fields (phone, address, restaurant type)
   - Added subscription tier selection (Pulse, Intelligence, Command)
   - Auto-redirect to POS connection after signup
   - Real name and restaurant name displaying correctly

2. **User Profile Display**
   - Created `/api/auth/me` endpoint for full user profile
   - MainLayout shows real firstName + lastName (not email prefix)
   - Sidebar shows real restaurant name (not "My Restaurant")
   - Role badges displaying correctly

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX NEXT SESSION

### 1. Home Page / Dashboard Loading Issues
**Current Status:** Dashboard showing "still loading"

**To Investigate:**
- [ ] How long does data loading actually take?
- [x] Check if correlation discovery programs are running - **FOUND ISSUE!**
- [ ] Verify all analytics jobs are executing properly
- [ ] Check Redis queue status
- [ ] Review worker logs for errors

**Location:** `/src/components/dashboard/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`

### 1.5. **CRITICAL: Correlation Engine Not Using Real Data** üö®
**Current Status:** Correlation discovery runs but finds 0 correlations

**Root Cause Identified:**
- **Weather correlations:** Using random/simulated data instead of real OpenWeatherMap API calls
  - Code says "Note: In production, fetch actual weather data"
  - Currently generates random temps: `baseTemp + (Math.random() * 20 - 10)`
  - OpenWeather API key is configured ‚úÖ but not being used ‚ùå

- **Event correlations:** Returns empty array - not implemented yet
  - Function just returns `[]` with TODO comment

- **Holiday correlations:** Partially implemented, needs testing

**Transaction Data Status:**
- ‚úÖ 5,851 transactions available (way more than 30 minimum)
- ‚úÖ Correlation discovery cron job runs successfully
- ‚ùå No correlations found because using fake data

**To Fix:**
- [ ] Update `/src/services/CorrelationEngine.ts` line 146-206
- [ ] Replace simulated weather with real `weatherService.getHistoricalWeather()` calls
- [ ] Implement actual event fetching in `analyzeEventCorrelations()`
- [ ] Test holiday correlation analysis
- [ ] Consider caching weather data to avoid rate limits

**Expected Outcome:**
Once fixed, should discover correlations like:
- "Rain decreases foot traffic by 25%"
- "Temperatures above 80¬∞F increase beverage sales by 35%"
- "Holiday weekends show 45% revenue increase"
- "Local events within 1 mile increase traffic by 20%"

**Files to Edit:**
- `/src/services/CorrelationEngine.ts` (lines 146-240)
- `/src/services/ExternalDataService.ts` (already has weather API ready)

### 2. Business Analytics Authorization Errors
**Current Status:** Owner getting "not authorized" when accessing business analytics

**To Fix:**
- [ ] Check Casbin policies for `analytics:all` permissions
- [ ] Verify route protection in `/src/app/dashboard/owner/page.tsx`
- [ ] Test authorization for all role types (owner, admin, manager, employee)
- [ ] Review middleware in business analytics endpoints

**Related Files:**
- `/src/lib/casbin/policies.ts`
- `/src/app/api/v2/analytics/owner/route.ts`
- `/src/middleware/authorize.ts`

### 3. Tasks & Workflows - Not Implemented Yet
**Current Status:** Owner seeing "not authorized" or "nothing assigned"

**To Build:**
- [ ] Task creation UI and API
- [ ] Workflow creation UI and API
- [ ] Task assignment system
- [ ] Task completion tracking
- [ ] Workflow templates
- [ ] Task notifications

**Existing Backend (needs testing):**
- ‚úÖ Models: `/src/models/Task.ts`, `/src/models/Workflow.ts`
- ‚úÖ API routes: `/src/app/api/v2/tasks/`, `/src/app/api/v2/workflows/`
- ‚ùå Frontend UI: Not built yet
- ‚ùå Integration with dashboard: Not connected

**Related Files:**
- `/src/app/tasks/page.tsx` - Needs implementation
- `/src/app/api/v2/tasks/route.ts` - Backend exists
- `/src/app/api/v2/workflows/route.ts` - Backend exists
