# Toast POS Integration - Implementation Summary

**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready (Manual GUID Entry)
**Production URL**: https://noion-aa4b03j7y-demetri-gregorakis-projects.vercel.app

---

## 🎯 What We Built

### Current Implementation: Manual GUID Entry (Option 2)

**User Flow:**
1. User goes to `/pos` page
2. Selects "Toast POS"
3. Sees professional credential entry form
4. Enters:
   - Client ID (from Toast API settings)
   - Client Secret (from Toast API settings)
   - Restaurant GUID (from Toast Web)
5. System connects to Toast API
6. Performs initial sync of last 30 days data
7. Redirects to dashboard with real data

**Why This Approach:**
- ✅ Works immediately - no Toast approval needed
- ✅ Can test with real Toast data right now
- ✅ Clean, professional UI with help documentation
- ❌ Requires manual GUID entry (temporary)
- ❌ Not scalable for many customers (temporary)

---

## 🧹 What We Cleaned Up

### Removed Fake OAuth Code

**Files Changed:**
1. `src/services/ToastIntegration.ts` - Removed `getAuthorizationUrl()` method
2. `src/app/api/auth/toast/callback/route.ts` - Now returns 404 with explanation
3. `src/app/api/restaurants/[id]/connect-pos/route.ts` - Updated to accept credentials in body
4. `src/components/pos/POSConnectionFlow.tsx` - Replaced fake OAuth with real form

**Why We Removed It:**
- Toast does NOT have traditional OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
- The `/oauth/authorize` endpoint doesn't exist
- No redirect-based user authorization in Toast API
- Was misleading and wouldn't work in production

---

## 🚀 Future Implementation: Partner Program (Option 1)

### Long-Term Goal: 1-Click Authorization

**How It Will Work:**
1. User signs up for NOION
2. Sees: "Enable NOION in your Toast account"
3. Goes to Toast Web → Integrations → Finds "NOION" → Clicks "Enable"
4. NOION receives webhook notification with restaurant GUID
5. Connection established automatically
6. User returns to NOION - dashboard loads with data

**No manual GUID entry. No OAuth redirects. Just 1 click.**

### Steps to Get There:

**1. Apply to Toast Partner Program**
- URL: https://pos.toasttab.com/partners/integration-partner-application
- Timeline: Approval can take weeks to months
- Requirements: Compliance, security, legal review

**2. Development Phase**
- Receive partner API credentials
- Implement webhook handler for restaurant connections
- Implement Partners API integration (`/partners/v1/restaurants`)
- Test in sandbox environment

**3. Certification**
- Schedule 1-hour demo with Toast team
- Review endpoint interactions, data handling
- Show data polling and transmission

**4. Beta Testing**
- Test with 3-5 real restaurants
- Collect feedback over several weeks
- Performance review by Toast

**5. General Availability**
- Listed in Toast marketplace
- All Toast customers can enable with 1-click

## 📋 Current Implementation Details

### New Components Created

**`src/components/pos/ToastCredentialsForm.tsx`**
- Professional form for entering Toast credentials
- Built-in help documentation
- Links to Toast API docs
- Error handling and validation
- Clean, user-friendly UI

### API Endpoints Updated

**`POST /api/restaurants/[id]/connect-pos`**
```json
{
  "posType": "toast",
  "clientId": "your-client-id",
  "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
  "restaurantGuid": "your-restaurant-guid"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "posType": "toast",
    "connected": true,
    "restaurantGuid": "d3efae34-7c2e-4107-a442-49081e624706"
  }
}
```

### Toast Connection Flow

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**
1. User submits credentials via form
2. API calls `ToastIntegration.connectRestaurant()`
3. Authenticates with Toast using client credentials
4. Stores encrypted access token in database
5. Calls `performInitialSync()` - fetches last 30 days of orders
6. Normalizes Toast transactions to NOION schema
7. Stores transactions in MongoDB
8. Returns success
9. Frontend redirects to dashboard
10. Dashboard fetches and displays real data

## 🔑 Where Users Find Their Credentials

### Client ID & Client Secret
1. Log into Toast Web
2. Go to **Admin → Integrations → API Access**
3. Create new API credentials (if needed)
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret

### Restaurant GUID
1. Log into Toast Web
2. Go to **Admin → Restaurant Info**
3. Look for "Restaurant GUID" or "External ID"
4. Copy the GUID (format: `d3efae34-7c2e-4107-a442-49081e624706`)

**Note:** Our form includes helpful instructions and links to Toast documentation.

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before (Fake OAuth):
- Click "Authorize" button
- Nothing happens (OAuth doesn't exist)
- Confusion and frustration

### After (Manual GUID Entry):
- Professional credential form
- Clear instructions on where to find credentials
- Links to Toast documentation
- Help tooltips explaining each field
- Immediate feedback on connection status
- Real data sync and dashboard

### Future (Partner Program):
- See: "Enable NOION in Toast Web"
- Go to Toast, click 1 button
- Return to NOION
- Everything works automatically

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User Submits Form
      ↓
API Endpoint (/api/restaurants/[id]/connect-pos)
      ↓
ToastIntegrationService.connectRestaurant()
      ↓
1. Authenticate with Toast (client credentials)
      ↓
2. Store encrypted access token
      ↓
3. performInitialSync()
      ↓
4. fetchTransactions() - Last 30 days
      ↓
5. normalizeTransaction() - Toast → NOION schema
      ↓
6. importTransactions() - Save to MongoDB
      ↓
7. Return success
      ↓
Frontend Redirect to Dashboard
      ↓
Dashboard API (/api/dashboard/[restaurantId])
      ↓
Fetch transactions and insights from MongoDB
      ↓
Display real data to user
```

### Database Schema

**Restaurant Document (updated fields):**
```typescript
{
  posConfig: {
    type: 'toast',
    isConnected: true,
    clientId: 'abc123',
    encryptedAccessToken: 'encrypted...',
    lastSyncAt: Date,
    managementGroupId: 'xyz789',
    locationId: 'd3efae34-7c2e-4107-a442-49081e624706'
  }
}
```

**Transaction Documents:**
- Automatically created during sync
- Normalized from Toast format
- Includes all order details, items, payments
- Ready for AI analysis

---

## 🔐 Security

### Credentials Storage
- Client secrets are **encrypted** before storage
- Uses AES-256-GCM encryption
- Encryption key from environment variable
- Never exposed in logs or responses

### API Authentication
- Toast access tokens refresh automatically
- 24-hour token expiry with auto-refresh
- Rate limiting (1000 req/hour) enforced
- All requests use HTTPS

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Manual GUID Entry Required**
   - Temporary until Partner Program approval
   - Not ideal UX but functional

2. **No Restaurant Auto-Discovery**
   - Can't automatically find all restaurants user has access to
   - Future: Partners API will list all authorized restaurants

3. **Single Restaurant at a Time**
   - Current flow connects one restaurant per form submission
   - Future: Batch import when Partner Program active

4. **Rate Limits Shared**
   - 1000 req/hour shared across all connected restaurants
   - Need to implement per-restaurant rate limiting as we scale
