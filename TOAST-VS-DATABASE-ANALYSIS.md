## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Revenue is $7,754 Lower

**Toast Calculation:**
```
Net Sales:     $193,821.79

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Total:         $229,669.28  (‚âà $230,474 with rounding)
```

**Database totalAmount:**
```
Sum of all transactions: $222,719.83
```

**Missing:** $7,754.19 (3.4%)

**Possible Reasons:**

   - Tips in Toast: $18,783
   - Missing amount: $7,754
   - Difference: $11,029 (could be partial tip import)

2. **Some transactions missing:**
   - 5,941 in database vs 5,942 in Toast (only 1 missing)
   - Not the main issue

3. **totalAmount calculation issue:**
   - Field might be importing Net Sales + Tax only
   - Missing Tips completely or partially
